🚨 Stop coding blind! Secure your app before it’s too late.
Did you know most vulnerabilities are introduced during development—not after deployment? That’s where Static Application Security Testing (SAST) comes in.

What is SAST?
SAST is a proactive security testing method that analyzes your application’s source code while it’s being developed. Instead of waiting for runtime issues, SAST scans your code early to detect flaws like SQL injection, XSS, and insecure configurations—before they become costly breaches.

Why should you care?

1️⃣Catch vulnerabilities early → Fixing issues in development costs 30x less than post-release.
2️⃣Improve code quality → Cleaner, safer code means fewer headaches later.
3️⃣Compliance made easy → Stay ahead of security standards and audits.


How does it work?
SAST tools integrate directly into your CI/CD pipeline. They scan your codebase without executing it, providing detailed reports on potential risks. Developers can then remediate issues immediately—keeping security and speed aligned.

Pro tip:
Combine SAST with DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) for a full-spectrum security approach. While SAST checks code statically, DAST tests running applications for real-world vulnerabilities.

Bottom line:
Security isn’t optional—it’s a responsibility. By adopting SAST, you’re not just writing code; you’re building trust, resilience, and confidence into your applications.
