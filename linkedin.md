Think your app is secure? DAST finds what static tests miss—real-time vulnerabilities before attackers do

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a game-changer for modern application security. Unlike static testing, which analyzes code without execution, DAST tests your running application in real-world conditions—just like an attacker would.
Why does this matter?

Realistic Testing: DAST simulates actual attack scenarios on live applications.
Language-Agnostic: Works regardless of programming language or framework.
Compliance & Risk Reduction: Helps meet security standards like OWASP Top 10.

Key Benefits:
✔ Detects runtime vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF).
✔ Integrates with CI/CD pipelines for DevSecOps.
✔ Improves security posture without slowing development.

Best Practices for DAST:

1️⃣ Combine with SAST for full coverage.
2️⃣ Automate scans in your CI/CD pipeline.
3️⃣ Regularly update test cases for new threats.

Security isn’t optional—it’s essential. If your application is live, attackers are already looking for weaknesses. DAST helps you stay ahead.
💡 Question for you: Are you using DAST in your security strategy? If not, what’s holding you back?

Your app is only as secure as its weakest dependency. Are you scanning your open-source components?
Open-source accelerates innovation—but it also introduces hidden risks. Did you know 80% of modern applications rely on third-party libraries? If those libraries have vulnerabilities, your entire system is exposed.
This is where Software Composition Analysis (SCA) comes in:
✔ Detects known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in open-source packages
✔ Ensures license compliance to avoid legal issues
✔ Monitors for outdated or risky dependencies
Why it matters:

1️⃣Supply chain attacks are on the rise
2️⃣Compliance requires visibility into your software bill of materials (SBOM)
3️⃣Attackers target dependencies, not just your code

Best Practices:
✅ Integrate SCA into your CI/CD pipeline for automated checks
✅ Maintain an SBOM for transparency
✅ Combine SCA with SAST & DAST for complete security coverage
Open-source is powerful—but unmanaged dependencies can be a ticking time bomb. SCA helps you stay secure, compliant, and ahead of threats.

Your website without TLS is like sending secrets on a postcard. Ready to lock it down—for free?
Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the backbone of secure internet communication. It encrypts data between your browser and the server, ensuring privacy, authentication, and integrity. Without TLS, sensitive information like passwords and payment details can be intercepted.
Why TLS matters:
✔ Protects against eavesdropping and tampering
✔ Builds user trust (that padlock icon in browsers)
✔ Required for compliance (PCI-DSS, GDPR, HIPAA)
✔ Boosts SEO—Google ranks HTTPS sites higher
How to get TLS certificates for FREE:
1️⃣ Let’s Encrypt – Non-profit CA offering free, automated certificates (90-day validity, auto-renew via Certbot).
2️⃣ ZeroSSL – Free 90-day certificates with easy dashboard and ACME support.
3️⃣ SSL For Free – Powered by ZeroSSL, quick issuance for multiple domains.
4️⃣ Cloudflare – Free SSL/TLS with CDN integration and auto-renewal.
Where & When to use TLS:
✅ Websites (HTTPS)
✅ APIs and microservices
✅ Email servers (SMTP, IMAP)
✅ VPNs and remote access
✅ Any app transmitting sensitive data

Best Practices:
✔ Use TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 (disable older versions)
✔ Automate renewals to avoid downtime
✔ Test your setup with SSL Labs for an A+ rating
Open web without encryption is a hacker’s playground. TLS is your first line of defense—and it doesn’t have to cost a dime.
